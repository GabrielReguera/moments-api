# moments-api
API used for Angular 13 course

# Important notes
This isn't the original API presented on the course. The original one was built with AdonisJs with multipart/form-data request support. I frequently work with JSON request/response pattern... so I decided to build the same API using Java and Spring boot to deal with this format.
